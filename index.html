                  <h2> Problem </h2>
                  Everyone has hobbies, interests, activities that we enjoy, that help relax or entertain us. Moreover, people with common interests tend to connect with each other in an easier manner, as they become more sociable while doing something they like. Events focusing on one activity that many people enjoy are already very common, but the downside is that every event needs someone to plan and organize it. This requires time and a lot of commitment on the planner's behalf.
                  </br>
                  <h2> Solution </h2>
                  We believe that such an event can be planned automatically, without the need for someone to be specifically involved in the process. Through an app, users register their interests and schedule (e.g. periods when they are available for such events). The app would be responsible with choosing an activity, a date and hour such that as many users interested in it as possible can attend the event, sending invitations to such users and selecting a venue (e.g. from a list of suitable locations, depending on the number of people attending the event). The human involvement is thus reduced to a minimum, as the only people who need to deal with preparations are the venue employees, who are already familiar with hosting such events.
                  </br>
                  We plan to discover customers mainly through social media and advertisement.
                  </br>
                  <h2> Customer segments </h2>
                  We identified our customer segment quickly because we are students, all of us have a job and time is very important for us. We don't want to waste it. So we found a solution for our planner time. 
                  After some face-to-face interviews with our colleagues, we have realised that we need a planner time so.. here we are!

                   <h2> Competition </h2>
                  Our competitors are Facebook Events and ????. Facebook Events helps you to organize an event, ??? organize events only for sports enthusiasts.


                  <h2>How did we find this?</h2>
                  <p>
                     We tried to discuss with close friends, our colleagues, our families to find out what their opinion was about the issue raised by us. We have discovered, following discussions, face-to-face interviews that the application can handle some of what our competitors lack.
                  </p>
                  </br>
                  <h2>Key metrics</h2>
                  <p>we will track the number of users and use this number to analyze the quality of our product. We expect it to increase over the weekend and during holidays</p>
                  </br>
                  <h2>Revenue streams</h2>
                  <p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>User fee: 5$/month (after a 30-day free trial)
                     </li>
                     <li>Contracts with partners(pubs, hotels, gyms)
                     </li>
                     <li>Ads inside app
                     </li>

                  </p>
                  </br>
                  Basing on the enthusiasm of our friends, yes, we are ready to move on. We like to be fast.. and furious.

                           <li>Person 1: I try how often I can, when I allow my time. </li>
                           <li>Person 2: Daily. Not all, but at least 2 every day. </li>
                           <li>Person 3: Lately, three to four times a year, unfortunately. </li>

                           <li>Person 1: Yes, I think I can not afford enough time and attention as much as I would like.</li>
                           <li>Person 2: Mostly, yes.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: I wish I could practice them at least 6 times.</li>

                     <li>
                        Are you satisfied with the way events are organized that include such activities?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1:  I have not seen events that include such activities.</li>
                           <li>Person 2: Most events of this type have had a good organization, but as always there can be many improvements that can be made.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: 
                              I'm rather happy, but I'd like more precision in setting up daytime activities.
                           </li>

                     <li>
                        Why do you think you have not seen such events?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1: Because nobody is thinking about organizing such events, and if they exist, they are not promoted enough.</li>
                           <li>Person 2: Age categories for some of the musical events for example. Access should only be made for those who are at least 16 or 18 years of age.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: Because it can be a hard work to organize a travel depending on people's preferences.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        What do you think there are the pros and cons of organizing such events by a person or a group of people?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1: As an pros, it offers something new to people and an opportunity to relax and socialize with people with common interests. As disadvantages, there might be a little disorganization and everyone might not be interested.</li>
                           <li>Person 2: The benefits are that they have been interacting with people who have participated in such events over time and noted their needs and demands to make events better. The disadvantages are that all the opinions can not be taken into account and can not meet the needs of all those there, but at least the majority is satisfied and a linear nucleus is created from the point of view of needs.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: The present disadvantages are multiple, but the predominant one involves the subjectivism of the organizer(s) that may attract dissatisfaction within a diversified group.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        How do you think the disadvantages could be overcome?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1: A larger organizing team and more time for preparing the event.</li>
                           <li>Person 2: Exceeded I do not think these disadvantages could be, but they can be limited, brought to a minimum by some good filters that satisfy the vast majority of people.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: These would be overcome by involving all participants in assuming all the established or eliminating the human / subjective factor.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Do you think such events would be more successful and would attract more interested people if the choice of location, date and time and sending invitations would be done automatically and not by a particular person?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1: Yes, because people are making mistakes and easier for everyone, both for organizers and for participants.</li>
                           <li>Person 2: I think it would have a helpful effect for larger events that already have a specific audience, a faithful target audience, but size increase will be more difficult for small and new events.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: Yes, because it would be a clear program set on an agenda with warnings of rigor.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Do you think such an automated organization would help you participate in more events that interest you?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1: Yes, since it would allow for better organization without the need for involvement of a person or a group of people. </li>
                           <li>Person 2: Because people enjoy more concrete and safe things, when it comes to new things, they are somewhat reluctant and it's about their time, which they sometimes do not want to risk by participating in an unknown event that might come out unpleasant.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: Yes, it will be easier for me to find travel partners.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Would you use an app to automatically organize events based on your interests and availability and other users?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1: Yes, because it seems a good and original idea that would make people with the same interests better acquainted, spend time together and learn from each other.</li>
                           <li>Person 2: I would give her a chance.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: Yes, sure.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        What expectations would you expect from such an app?
                        <ul>
                           <li>Person 1: D
                              Meet people with the same interests.
                           </li>
                           <li>Person 2: Offer many events based on the interests that I show. Also, I offer some events that are associated with my interests, not necessarily from the categories I have selected.</li>
                           <li>Person 3: Firstly, I would like that, based on the budget and location, my application can identify all the activities that fit our criteria and, depending on this, each of the participants can vote so that at the end, to keep a list of the main activities that we can put into practice. I would love the application to send warnings before check in.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>

               <h2>The volume of our target market (including the different sub-markets)</h2>
               <p>
                  The market for FUNNECT is represented in a first phase of Bucharest. Subsequently, for the growth of the user we will expand in the main cities in Romania such as Brasov, Timisoara, Cluj-Napoca and Iasi. The number of possible users is estimated at half the number of people between 18 and 40 years, respectively 250,000 users (according to Bucharest Pollution in ages). In order to move on to the expansion of the application in other cities, we have to overcome an initial number of 50,000 users in Bucharest, of which 25,000 will be active. The final volume for the Romanian market is 700,000-800,000 users.
               </p>
               <h2>The approximate number of players / competitors in your targeted market</h2>
               <p>
                  We identified one major platform for connecting people with the same passions: Ludicon. It owns a monopoly on this market being the only application of its kind.
                  Ludicon creates a dedicated meeting point for sports enthusiasts, through an online platform in which anyone can create sport events, invite participants, and get points for their effort. Ludicon combines the passion of sports with the thrills of gamification, in order to stimulate people to create the perfect team for the perfect match in football, basketball, ping pong, squash, volley, tennis, cycling, jogging and others.
               </p>
               <h2>The competition and if possible market share for each competitor</h2>
               <p>
                  Ludicon is the project that aims to link the four major sporting entities: sports lovers, sports models, sports fields and sports retailers. Ludicon owns about 2,000 users in Bucharest. This application has been recently launched and is under development. This allows us to gain a market share with funnect, as the market has not yet been captured.
                  What Funnect can do is cover a larger beach of activities and this can gain in front of competitor on the market, making possible both applications of this kind.
               </p>
               <h2>The potential market share in year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 after launch</h2>

               <ul>
                  <li>Year 1: we expect that our market share will be around 40%, taking into account that it addresses a wide audience, regardless of the field of the hobby</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Year 3: we expect that our monopole of the market will be shattered, due to the apparition of another competitors. We will try to keep our percentage at 48%</li>
                  <li>Year 4: we will follow a growth plan and we will try to add attractive new features that will allow us to 
                     to attract the market to the detriment of the competitor (from 48% to 60%)
                  </li>
                  <li>Year 5: we will try to close a deal with other competitors and to increase our market, giving the best social app to our clients (from 60% to 80%)
